# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

- [x] Please implement using ruby ~> 2.7.5, with Rails 5+

● No user accounts or authentication are necessary

● We care about simple phone reservation requests like "I'd like seating for 4 at 7pm on Friday".

● We do NOT need to think about special requests ("I want to be near the window", etc)

● You can choose as many tables you want to fill requested capacity. Please define your own sample set of 10 tables, ranging from seating capacity from 2-8 people.

● The UI should be a list of all existing reservations, and a field to enter the name and date/time for a new reservation request.

● Submitting a new request should either add the reservation and display a success message, or show a capacity error.

● Please use sqlite, mysql, or postgres for the database.

● Write tests in the framework of your choice.

● Please use as few gems as possible to get the task completed efficiently.

● Implement a responsive design, using either Bootstrap or Foundation CSS (Foundation preferred if you know both)

● Please aim for a clean and intuitive interface.
